## Hello! 

I'm a tech omnivore with a background in software and data engineering. I specialize in building scalable data-driven infrastructures and helping companies make data-driven decisions for business growth.  

Apart from coding, I maintain a blog - you can find my articles [here](https://bit.ly/azariagebremichael)(poorly maintained). I also try to pay my dues as a citizen on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13011799/azaria-gebremichael). 

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azaria-gebremichael/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/azariagmt), or [instagram](https://instagram.com/azariagebremichael).
